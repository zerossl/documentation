# REST API Error Codes



## Error Codes



Whenever there is an error processing your API request, the API will return a straightforward JSON error message carrying a `success` response object set to `false`, an error code as well as a text-based error type.



You will find an example error as well as a list of all possible error codes and messages below.



**Example Error:**



```
{
    "success": false,
    "error": {
        "code": 2803,
        "type": "certificate_not_found"
    }
}
```
