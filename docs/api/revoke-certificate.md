# REST API Revoke Certificate



## Revoke CertificateHTTPS POST

<div class="split-heading">
  <h2>Revoke Certificate</h2>
  <span class="method">HTTPS POST</span>
</div>



To revoke an issued certificate using the ZeroSSL API you will need to make an HTTPS POST request to the API endpoint below and specify your certificate using its ID (hash) inside the URL's `{id}` parameter, as shown below.



Possible reasons why you might want to revoke an issued certificate:



* There is any risk that its private key might have been compromised (urgent)
* The domain it was issued for is no longer operational
* The contents of the certificate are wrong



Warning
Make sure to use this endpoint with care and do only revoke certificates you really want to revoke. Only certificates with status `issued` can be revoked.
If a certificate has already been successfully revoked you will get a success response nevertheless.
